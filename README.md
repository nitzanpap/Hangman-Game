#Hang-Man Game
This is the final project in the [self.py](https://nitzanpap.github.io/TicTacToeJS/) course. It is a Hangman game.

First of all, the player enters a path for a .txt file 
containing english words, separated by one whitespace.
Secondly, the player enters a natural number thus pointing to a word
within the file.

The rules of the game itself are fairly simple -
the player guesses a letter which s/he thinks is in the word, and
the program checks the guess and reacts accordingly.

The goal? Guess the right letters before you run out of tries, And win the game!
